        There are many things I would like to change such as who develops the internet, where it is centralized and the privatization. Unfortunately, there is a lot that would almost make me change the entire era. I would have to try and assemble a team of different multicultural people women and men. I would want to decentralize the backbone of the internet. The quickest way would be to just be the first one to propose my project and take the control of the computer and internet first. I should also promote the open-source and free content of the internet. So probably go find Bill Gates and teach him about not privatizing things.
        The funding part would be quite difficult. since as much as I would like to not have to make a deal with the military or the government. I would either need to cheat at the lottery a little or try to find someone that would give me all the of the funding I need, most likely finding someone with the same values but if that doesn't work I guess blackmailing is always an option.
        The "great man theory" is contradictory to my thoughts. I don't think that it's a good way to describe the history of the internet or anything really for that matter. I don't believe that there is a single person that can pioneer an entirely new technology by themself alone. There are always others and context and time to take into account

      Well, it sounds like the infrastructure is already mostly installed. So I would use the already existing infrastructure but instead of connecting to the South, I would put in place an equivalent for the services but own by companies of our country. I would give funding to the companies that can offer the major online service but with the exchange that they become a state company. (Hydro-Quebec) By doing so there could be less risk of another country's ISP to just come in like previously. The is also no need to have only one company for all the online services, there can be many for the different needs. The fact that it will also become a state company would ideally make it that it becomes a basic service just like electricity, water, etc. To encourage the companies I would also restrict the use of the online service to only be through the local's ones for some time to allow the population to become accustomed to the new platforms. if the infrastructure is not installed then I would probably have to commission it and make a state company for the internet from the ground up, but I would try to form people to be able to join the company when they are adults. So maybe also give scholarships or things to encourage that route.
      The only problem I am unsure of is that I doubt that we can just make a backbone for the internet by ourself which would mean that we may need to still pay to the south to get connected to the rest of the world
